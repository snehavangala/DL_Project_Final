# FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION USING SIAMESE NETWORK WITH RESNET-50, RESNET-18 AND VGG16
This Main objective of this Project is to implement Face detection and recognization using Siamese network and VGG16 architecture  using the deep learning techniques to enhance accuracy and robustness. Heer we train the siamese network on a diverse dataset capturing various facial characteristics. Our architecture uncludes ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 as the base models for feature extraction, leveraging their residual blocks and Global Average Pooling layers. The siamese network will focus on learning facial similarity  through shared embeddings and a distance metric, enabling accurate detection of dissimilarity or similarity between faces. Additionally, We will add VGG16 for face recognition, Utilizing its powerful convolutional layers and fully connected head to classify faces into different categories based on their features.
